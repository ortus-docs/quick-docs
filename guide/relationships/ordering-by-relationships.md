# Ordering By Relationships

To order by a relationship field, you will use a dot-delimited syntax.

```javascript
getInstance( "Post" ).orderBy( "author.name" );
```

The last item in the dot-delimited string should be an attribute on the related entity.

Nested relationships are also supported.  Continue to chain relationships in your dot-delimited string until arriving at the desired entity.  Remember to end with the attribute to order by.

```javascript
getInstance( "Post" ).orderBy( "author.team.name" );
```

If you desire to be explicit, you can use the `orderByRelated` method, which is what is being called under the hood.

| Name             | Type                | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| relationshipName | String \| \[String] | `true`   |         | A dot-delimited string of relationship names or an array of relationship names to traverse to get to the related entity to order by. |
| columnName       | string              | `true`   |         | The column name in the final relationship to order by.                                                                               |
| direction        | string              | `false`  | `"asc"` | The direction to sort, `asc` or `desc`.                                                                                              |

```javascript
getInstance( "Post" ).orderByRelated( "author.team", "name" );
// or
getInstance( "Post" ).orderByRelated( [ "author", "team" ], "name" );
```

You might prefer the explicitness of this method, but it cannot handle normal orders like `orderBy`.  Use whichever method you prefer.
